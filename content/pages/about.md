Title: About Me


## Hey,

My name is Sandesh, I am a Web Developer based in India.

I have over 5 years of experience in IT Industry, including a year long experience in working remotely for an Organisation based in UK.

I primarily work in `Python`, developing RESTful API's using `Django Rest Framework`.

I also have worked in `PostgreSQL & MongoDB`. I have fair experience in front-end technology like `HTML, CSS & JavaScript`.

Talking about Cloud platforms, I have experience with deploying  django web apps on `AWS` using `Nginx & Gunicorn`.

Right now, I am exploring `ReactJS`, so that I can develop end-to-end applications supporting RESTful API's.


Thanks for visiting my blog!
